\section{Details of Lab 4-6}

Here follows an account of laboratory 4, section 6. This section follows the original lab specification to detail a report, the ``Report of Lab 4-6'' is found in section 2.

\begin{question}

    The {\it Mesa-style} condition variables as first described in ``Experience with Processes and Monitors in Mesa'' can be described in the same way as the provided Hoare-style condition variable as follows:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item{
            {\tt Wait()} method
            \begin{verbatim}
count++;
mutex->V();
sem->P();
count--;
mutex->P();
            \end{verbatim}
        }
        \item{
            {\tt Signal()} method
            \begin{verbatim}
if (count > 0) sem->V();
            \end{verbatim}
        }
    \end{itemize}

    Notice the lack of a {\tt next-count} and {\tt next} variable. This is so because Mesa-style condition variables do not preserve a relationship between signaller and waiter.

\end{question}
\begin{question}
    After implementing a new monitor, ring, and Mesa-style condition variable, I tested my results as follows:

    \begin{verbatim}
$ make
...
ln -sf arch/unknown-i386-linux/bin/nachos nachos
$ ./nachos
No threads ready or runnable, and no pending interrupts.
Assuming the program completed.
Machine halting!

Ticks: total 1150, idle 0, system 1150, user 0
Disk I/O: reads 0, writes 0
Console I/O: reads 0, writes 0
Paging: faults 0
Network I/O: packets received 0, sent 0

Cleaning up...
$ ls tmp_*
tmp_0  tmp_1
$ cat tmp_0
producer id --> 0; Message number --> 0;
producer id --> 1; Message number --> 0;
producer id --> 0; Message number --> 1;
producer id --> 1; Message number --> 1;
producer id --> 1; Message number --> 2;
producer id --> 2; Message number --> 0;
producer id --> 2; Message number --> 1;
producer id --> 3; Message number --> 0;
producer id --> 3; Message number --> 1;
producer id --> 3; Message number --> 2;
$ cat tmp_1
producer id --> 0; Message number --> 2;
producer id --> 2; Message number --> 2;
    \end{verbatim}

    As you can see, the messages are ordered numerically by producer, and there are no repeated messages. This is a sign of a working program.

\end{question}

\section{Report of Lab 4-6}

\begin{question}

    I will now describe my analysis and design (including the algorithm) of Mesa style conditional variables (i.e. Section 2 of Lab4-6) using semaphores.

    The Mesa style condition variable algorithm is simpler than the Hoare-style algorithm as it does not wait on the signalled process. The wait function releases the mutex and P's on the {\tt sem} semaphore initialized to 0. Since the mutex is released, other threads can do work and a signalling process can signal, calling V on {\tt sem}. The important part of this is that the signalling process neither releases the mutex or the processor as it would using Hoare-style condition variables. The waiting process, now awoken, will attempt to access the semaphore. This means that the waiting process may or may not have the mutex when the waiting condition is true, and must wait once again, thusly the {\tt while} loop on the wait lines.

    Another important note is that mesa style condition variables have no concept of an urgent sempahore and count (next and next-count) like Hoare outlines in ``MONITORS: AN OPERATING SYSTEM STRUCTURING CONCEPT'' as follows on Section 2 labeled ``Interpretation'':

    \begin{quote}
        \begin{verbatim}
condcount :=condcount+l;
if urgentcount > 0 then V(urgent) else V(mutex);
P(condsem);
condcount :=condcount-1.
        \end{verbatim}
    The signal operation may be coded:
        \begin{verbatim}
urgentcount :=urgentcount+l;
if condcount > 0 then {V(condsem); P(urgent)};
urgentcount :=urgentcount-1.
        \end{verbatim}
    \end{quote}

    This concept is completely ignored in the Mesa style monitor, as specified in the corresponding paper ``Experience with Processes and Monitors in Mesa,'' Section 4, ``Condition variables'', where the simple {\it notify} concept is used to describe the {\bf signal} operation. The signal operation here is implemented as a V operation to the condition variable semaphore (sem). A release of monitior lock (mutex), P operation on the conditon variable's semaphore (sem), and a subsequent reaquisition of lock defines {\bf wait}. This must also be accompanied by a count increment before lock (mutex) release and count decrement after release from sem to avoid the regain of the monitor when in the midst of waiting leading to an ignored signal. Also, this count must exist so that calls to signal do not ``notify'' if there is nothing waiting on the semaphore (sem).

\end{question}

\begin{question}

    I will now submit the implementation, that is, the relevant source codes of the monitor class, ring class, Condition M class, and other related codes

    Here follows the Mesa style condition variable code:

    \begin{verbatim}
class Condition_M {
  public:
    Condition_M(char* debugName, Monitor *m);   // initialize condition to
                                                // "no one waiting"
    ~Condition_M();                             // deallocate the condition
    char* getName() { return (name); }

    void Wait();
    void Signal();

  private:
    char* name;
    // plus some other stuff you'll need to define

    Semaphore *sem; // semaphore for the waiting threads;
    int  count;     // the number of waiting threads;

    Monitor* mon;   // the pointer to the Monitor to which this condition
                    // variable belongs
};

// condition variables in Mesa's style
Condition_M::Condition_M(char *debugName, Monitor *m)
    : name(debugName),
    sem(new Semaphore(name, 0)), // uses the same name as cond var
    count(0),
    mon(m) {}

Condition_M::~Condition_M()
{
    delete sem;
}

void Condition_M::Wait()
{
    IntStatus oldLevel = interrupt->SetLevel(IntOff);

    count++;
    mon->mutex->V();
    sem->P();
    count--;
    mon->mutex->P();

    (void) interrupt->SetLevel(oldLevel);
}


void Condition_M::Signal()
{
    IntStatus oldLevel = interrupt->SetLevel(IntOff);

    if (count > 0) sem->V();

    (void) interrupt->SetLevel(oldLevel);
}
    \end{verbatim}

    Here follows the monitor class:

    \begin{verbatim}
class Monitor {
public:
    Monitor(char *debugName);   // default contructuctor
    ~Monitor();              // default destructor

    // const function attribute guarantees no side effects.
    char *getName() const { return name; }
private:
    char *name;
public:
    Semaphore* mutex;   // the semaphore for mutual exclusion
protected:
    void Entry();       // The entry for critical section of monitor functions
    void Exit();        // The exit for critical section of monitor functions
};

Monitor::Monitor(char *debugName)
    : name(debugName),
    mutex(new Semaphore(name, 1)) {}

Monitor::~Monitor() {
    delete mutex;
}

void Monitor::Entry() {
    mutex->P();
}

void Monitor::Exit() {
    mutex->V();
}
    \end{verbatim}

    Note that the semaphore {\tt next} and integer {\tt next-count} were removed from the class completely.

    Here follows the ring class's changed portions:

    \begin{verbatim}
// class of the slot in the ring-buffer
class slot {
    public:
    slot(int id, int number);
    slot() { thread_id = 0; value = 0;};

    int thread_id;
    int value;
    };


class Ring : public Monitor{
  public:
    Ring(char *debugName, int sz);    // Constructor:  initialize variables, allocate space.
    ~Ring();         // Destructor:   deallocate space allocated above.


    void Put(slot *message); // Put a message the next empty slot.

    void Get(slot *message); // Get a message from the next  full slot.

    int Full();       // Returns non-0 if the ring is full, 0 otherwise.
    int Empty();      // Returns non-0 if the ring is empty, 0 otherwise.

  private:
    int size;           // The size of the ring buffer.
    int in, out;        // Index of
    slot *buffer;       // A pointer to an array for the ring buffer.
    int current;        // the current number of full slots in the buffer

    Condition_M *notfull;   // condition variable to wait until not full
    Condition_M *notempty;  // condition variable to wait until not empty
};

Ring::Ring(char *debugName, int sz)
    : Monitor(debugName), size(sz), in(0), out(0), buffer(new slot[size]),
    current(0),
    notfull(new Condition_M("notfull", (Monitor *) this)),
    notempty(new Condition_M("notempty", (Monitor *) this)) {

    if (size < 1) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Error: Ring: size %d too small\n", sz);
        exit(1);
    }
}

Ring::~Ring()
{
    // Some compilers and books tell you to write this as:
    //     delete [size] stack;
    // but apparently G++ doesn't like that.

    delete [] buffer;
    delete notfull;
    delete notempty;
}

void Ring::Put(slot *message) {
    Entry();
    while (Full()) {
        notfull->Wait();
    }
    buffer[in].thread_id = message->thread_id;
    buffer[in].value = message->value;
    in = (in + 1) % size;
    current++; // one more in ring.
    notempty->Signal();
    Exit();
}

void Ring::Get(slot *message) {
    Entry();
    while (Empty()) {
        notempty->Wait();
    }
    message->thread_id = buffer[out].thread_id;
    message->value = buffer[out].value;
    out = (out + 1) % size;
    current--; // one less in ring.
    notfull->Signal();
    Exit();
}
    \end{verbatim}

    Note the only change in this class is the while loop on Waits.

\end{question}

\begin{question}

    Then I submitted the testing results (i.e. the contents of the tmp x files) for the following configurations using random seed 96.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item{Buffer Size: 2}
        \item{Number of Producers: 4}
        \item{Number of Messages per Producer: 3}
        \item{Number of Consumers: 2}
    \end{itemize}

    The following is the output for configuration one:

    \begin{verbatim}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item{Buffer Size: 5}
        \item{Number of Producers: 3}
        \item{Number of Messages per Producer: 4}
        \item{Number of Consumers: 3}
    \end{itemize}

    The following is the output for configuration two:

    \begin{verbatim}

$ ./nachos -rs 96

producer id --> 1; Message number --> 1;
producer id --> 0; Message number --> 3;
producer id --> 2; Message number --> 3;
    \end{verbatim}

    The order of the outputs and the number of occurences of a number per producer equaling one shows that this program is operational.

\end{question}
